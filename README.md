Solution to intermediate developer assignment

1. Please use command "npm test" from the root folder to run the tests.
2. Please use command "npm run deploy" to launch the server and client side application.
3. I put a higher bound of 40000000 on the input so application doesnt crash because of exceeding memory.

Thanks for the opportunity.
